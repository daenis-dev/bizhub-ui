# Checkers Antivirus UI

### Overview

Checkers provides a free suite of easy to use antivirus software services over the web. The initial product offering allows the user to backup up to ten gigabytes of files.

This repository is used to manage changes to the UI codebase. Navigate to the [demo project repository](https://github.com/daenis-dev/checkers-antivirus-demo) for setup instructions, API documentation and additional project notes.



### Running Automated Tests

- Install Node

- Navigate to the project directory and run the following command

  ```
  npm test
  ```



# Notice

The project has recently pivoted from a file integrity monitoring solution to a file backup solution. The UI is outdated, and will be updated soon.



Thank you for your patience!
